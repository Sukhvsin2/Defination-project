          I grew up believing atheism was negative concept, however, with the
          age & understanding. I can now understand why some may not want to
          affiliate with a religion due to some questionable qualities of many
          religious groups.

          I never had a particular view about theism. I come from a society that
          believes that atheists are a negative influence. But this research
          broadened my perspective and made me look into both beliefs.

          My experience with atheism to this point has been mostly negative. I
          felt as though those adhering to the tradition were simply trying to
          push an agenda against my beliefs. Now, however, I understand that we
          have a lot more in common than I once thought.

          My perception of Atheism has changed tremendously. After doing
          research on Atheism, I have learned that they face a lot of
          persecution and they deserve respect just like every other religion.
